It works on both the client and server-side environments and can be used to communicate with any back-end or API that exposes an HTTP interface. Axios supports a wide range of features such as interceptors, request cancellation, automatic transformation of JSON data, support for different types of responses (JSON, XML, Buffer), and more. Overall, it provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface for handling HTTP requests and responses.\n\nUsage:\n\n```\nconst axios = require('$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/axios/axios.min.js');\n```\n\nThen, if you use [[Tiddly.ModernDev|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/Modern.TiddlyDev]]:\n\n```\nimport axios from '$:/plugins/Gk0Wk/axios/axios.min.js';\n```\n\n> This plugin uses the flexible and powerful <$text text=\"TiddlyWiki\" /> development framework [[Tiddly.ModernDev|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/Modern.TiddlyDev]]\n",
